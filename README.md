## **award**

## Problem & Goal

NOXCAT-Digital-Abyss turns blockchain and NOXCAT ecosystem knowledge into an interactive pixel-platform experience. It is designed for players who are new to Web3, wallets, and digital assets, making complex concepts easier to explore through gameplay.

## Core Features

- 2D side-scrolling gameplay with movement, double jump, hazards, checkpoints, and moving platforms.
- Enemy encounters trigger blockchain and NOXCAT multiple-choice questions.
- Correct answers defeat enemies without damage; wrong answers reduce HP.
- Browser-based gameplay with keyboard, mobile touch controls, score, timer, and Web Audio sound.
